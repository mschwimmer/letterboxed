README

The reference list of words was taken from [Aliceyliang's solver](https://github.com/aliceyliang/letter-boxed-solver/blob/master/README.md?plain=1)

The goal of this webapp is to help me get two word solutions for NYT Letter Boxed.

Often I would have 1 really good word, but couldn't figure out the second word in the two word solution. I wanted to make an app that can let me know if I'm barking up the wrong tree, or if there's actually a second word for me to find.
