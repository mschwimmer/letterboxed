Letter Boxed Homie

[Homie](https://letterboxedhomie.vercel.app)

The reference list of words was taken from [Aliceyliang's solver](https://github.com/aliceyliang/letter-boxed-solver/blob/master/README.md?plain=1)

We all know that when it comes to the New York Times' popular game 'Letter Boxed,' anything more than a two word solution is a failure (don't listen to the three word solvers' acceptance of mediocrity).
Often I would have 1 really good word, but couldn't figure out the second word in the two word solution for the day's puzzle.
I wanted to make an app that can let me know if I'm barking up the wrong tree, or if there's actually a second word for me to find.

So, I created the homie for the popular New York Times game 'Letter Boxed'.
